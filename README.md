## Project Title
Appointment planner
## Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I completed it on 28.09.23 as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer path. The routing was already implemented, and the task involved following instructions to complete the rest of the components and make them interact with each other. It puts into practice the following skills: useEffect() hook; useState() hook; props; and HTML forms.
The app allows a user to add contacts on the /contacts page, and then create new appointments on the /appointments page, choosing from a drop-down list of the contacts they added.
